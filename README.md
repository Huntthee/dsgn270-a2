This website will be developed as I learn more in classes and apply my knowledge to the site. 

Over the course of the next few months **I intend to**:

- Upload frequently
- Update the README
- Update the site with more functionality and style
- Improve accessibility and performance

It was difficult to come up with some idea of what to do for my project site, but I believe this will be a good way for me to practice, and record such progress at the same time.

For now everything is very basic.
