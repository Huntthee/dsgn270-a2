## The Beginning

 >The purpose of this blog will be to document and share my progress as I learn to code and develop websites! As I go forward I will post about the various projects and work I complete, as well as link to the github repositories I create.

![computer and notes](https://i.picsum.photos/id/180/2400/1600.jpg?hmac=Ig-CXcpNdmh51k3kXpNqNqcDYTwXCIaonYiBOnLXBb8)

So far I have been teaching myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the run up to the Web Development course at SAIT, and now beginning to code in the course itself.

This first post will contain links to the projects I worked on previous to school, as well as some of the simpler introductory assignments we have done already.

**Pre-class Projects**
- [Incomplete Portfolio Site](https://github.com/Huntthee/majjic)
- [Basic Mimo project site](https://github.com/Huntthee/Huntthee.github.io) "will be revamping"

**In-class Projects**
- [This page itself!](#)
- [Template site 1](https://github.com/Huntthee/cpnt201-a1-pixfly)
- [Template site 2](https://github.com/Huntthee/cpnt201-a1-ethereal)
- [Template site 3](https://github.com/Huntthee/cpnt201-a1-editorial)
- [Website Critique](https://github.com/Huntthee/DSGN270-a1/blob/main/dsgn270-a1.md)

Though some of these are fairly simple, they represent what I've been doing, and am capable of as I begin classes. And I look forward to learning so much more during my time at SAIT.

## Another One Bites The Dust

The second week of this course went over a lot of things I have already learned, however the refresher is good and a few blanks have also been filled in.

I believe my CSS and HTML from this point forward will certainly look more structured, with increased readability as well.

### Next Week

I look forward to a more in-depth look at CSS Flexbox and Grid for creating responsive templates with relative ease. I have previously played with both concepts in a few projects on my own and definitely enjoy the simplicity of grid.

Flexbox is a strange one but I am beginning to understand how to move things around and shift the 'items' in the 'container'.

For the most part I'm excited to get into the JavaScript, as thats where I am finding the most difficulties. I find that I can read and more-or-less understand what a certain block of code will do. But struggle to write out a function for myself.

Perhaps a bit of time on [Free Code Camp](https://www.Freecodecamp.com) will help me get a more solid grasp on creating my own functions, and add some 'functionality' to my pages.

### This Week's Projects

**Codepen**
- [My Pens](https://codepen.io/huntthee) Worked on Font Pairing and some Navigation principles
- [Edits to this page!](https://github.com/Huntthee/cpnt270-a2/blob/main/index.md)

## Flexbox Funtime!

Monday kicked off with a more in-depth look at CSS Flexbox and the funky things it can do. With a little bit of practice on 'Flexbox Zombies' 'Flexbox Frog' and perhaps some more lessons on CodeCamp, I feel that mastering such a tool will allow for some really neat website layouts.

With that in mind I anticipate learning some CSS Grid will pair very nicely with the abilities of Flexbox. Navigation menues are certainly easier having to only write a couple lines of code.

My to-do list for this week isn't as daunting as last week's seemed to have been, but I will complete the assignments as I have been doing so far. Early and as complete as can be!

I have noticed that the information I have gathered on my own from sources such as W3Schools indeed has been outdated, and that the SAIT course so far has been a great opportunity to fill in the blanks and catch up to the current methods and practices.

**Monday's practice**
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/huntthee/pen/VwKJgRb) Played around with more nav ideas
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/huntthee/pen/LYRKqox) Attempted recreation of nav menu
