# A Simple Coding Blog

*by Mike Allison*

## The Beginning
The purpose of this blog will be to document and share my progress as I learn to code and develop websites! As I go forward I will post about the various projects and work I complete, as well as link to the github repositories I create.

So far I have been teaching myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the run up to the Web Development course at SAIT, and now beginning to code in the course itself.

This first post will contain links to the projects I worked on previous to school, as well as some of the simpler introductory assignments we have done already.

**Pre-class Projects**
- [Incomplete Portfolio Site](https://github.com/Huntthee/majjic)
- [Basic Mimo project site](https://github.com/Huntthee/Huntthee.github.io) "will be revamping"

**In-class Projects**
- [This page itself!](#)
- [Template site 1](https://github.com/Huntthee/cpnt201-a1-pixfly)
- [Template site 2](https://github.com/Huntthee/cpnt201-a1-ethereal)
- [Template site 3](https://github.com/Huntthee/cpnt201-a1-editorial)
- [Website Critique](https://github.com/Huntthee/DSGN270-a1/blob/main/dsgn270-a1.md)

Though some of these are fairly simple, they represent what I've been doing, and am capable of as I begin classes. And I look forward to learning so much more during my time at SAIT.
